##Roadblocks I Encountered: 

 I actually had never used the component/container model. So I had to read up on it and do my best to build things with that pattern. It was trial and error, and I realize saying that will probably cost me a job offer, but I'm proud that I was able to take a unfamiliar concept and implement it relatively quickly. I learned how to better structure projects and become a better developer over the course of this. Thank you all for that. It was challenging and on the list item I ended up going for getting it functional over keeping exactly to a pattern as I was having trouble writing the methods in the container. After having used the pattern, I think it is a great way to structure apps and to build re-usable chunks of code. I'm definitely going to keep using it on projects I'm working on now like a basic blogging platform built in React and a 'make-smart-workout-programs' app that lets coaches create training programs that automatically update based on athlete feedback. 

 The way I understood the Component/Container model was that it was like putting an MVC architecture on a react project, so to keep my brain working I ended up using a firebase backend for the M part of that.

 Styling, I was running short on time so I used bootstrap. It's not the most visually stunning app but it works and is to spec.  

 ##Deploying app on any server: 

 Since this is an SPA we don't really need to worry about routing or anything, so setting up your server to return `index.html` from the public folder to a visitor would accomplish the task after the app is uploaded to the server. 

 ##Final Thoughts

 This is also the first ever README I've written. This whole experience has been great so thank you all so much for giving me the opportunity to build this!!! It makes me feel that regardless of if I get a job offer, I am learning and improving and the time I've put in to learn how to code is going to lead somewhere.
